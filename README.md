## 🚀 Features

OrionStore is a **Progressive Android Application** that acts as a fully functional App Store without requiring a dedicated backend server. It runs entirely on GitHub and can be compiled to a native APK using **Capacitor**.

*   **🎨 Material You 3 Design:** A vibrant, Gen Z aesthetic featuring "Acid" and "Neon" accents with smooth animations.
*   **🤖 Native Android Support:** Built with Capacitor to run directly on Android devices with native performance.
*   **🌗 Adaptive Theming:** Seamless Light, Dusk, and Dark modes.
*   **☁️ Serverless Architecture:** Powered 100% by GitHub JSON & Releases. No database required.
*   **🤖 Auto-Mirroring Engine:** Built-in scraper (Puppeteer) that finds updates for apps like Spotify, Instagram, etc., and re-uploads them to your repo automatically.
*   **⚡ Smart Caching:** LocalStorage caching strategy for instant loads and offline capability.
---

## 🛠 How It Works

OrionStore uses a unique **"Repo-as-a-Backend"** approach:

1.  **Frontend (`App.tsx`):** Fetches `config.json` and `apps.json` from the repository.
2.  **Database (`apps.json`):** Contains metadata (Name, Icon, Description) and links to GitHub Repositories.
3.  **The Engine:**
    *   The app checks the `mirror.json` file for the absolute latest releases.
    *   If `releaseKeyword` is set, it scans the **last 10 releases** of a repo to find the specific app variant you need (supporting multi-app monorepos).
    *   It compares the remote version with the local version stored in the browser/app.

## 📱 Native Android Build

This project is configured with **Capacitor**, allowing you to convert the web app into a native `.apk` file easily.

### Prerequisites
1.  Install Android Studio.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android
    npx cap add android
    ```

### Building the APK
```bash
# 1. Build the React web project
npm run build

# 2. Sync the web assets to the native Android project
npx cap sync

# 3. Open Android Studio to build the Signed APK
npx cap open android
```
## 👨‍💻 Developer Mode

OrionStore includes a hidden debug menu for power users and contributors to manage API limits and data sources.

### 🔓 How to Unlock
1.  Navigate to the **About** tab (or stay on Home).
2.  Tap the **"OrionStore"** logo in the top-left header **9 times** rapidly.
3.  A toast notification will appear confirming you are now a developer.
4.  Scroll down to the bottom of the **About** tab to see the new options.

### 🛠️ Capabilities
*   **🔑 API Key Management:** Input your own **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** to increase API rate limits from **60/hr** to **5000/hr**. This is essential if you are browsing the store frequently or developing.
*   **🔀 Data Source Toggle:** Switch between **Remote** (Live JSON from GitHub) and **Local** (Hardcoded `localData.ts`) modes. Useful for testing new apps without committing to the repo.
*   **🔥 Nuke Cache:** A "Wipe Cache & Reset" button to clear all `localStorage` data and reset the app state if things get stuck.

## 🤖 Auto-Mirror System

This is the heart of the automation. You don't need to manually upload APKs.

### 1. Configuration
Edit `mirror_config.json` to tell the bot which apps to track.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "instagram-mod",
    "name": "Instagram",
    "downloadUrl": "https://an1.com/1029-instagram-apk.html",
    "mode": "scrape",
    "wait": 30000
  }
]
```

### 2. The Workflow (`.github/workflows/auto_mirror.yml`)
*   Runs daily at **00:00 UTC**.
*   **Direct Mode:** Wget/Curl direct links.
*   **Scrape Mode:** Uses **Puppeteer** with stealth plugins to bypass Cloudflare, navigate download pages (like AN1 or APKDone), and extract the APK.
*   **Publishing:** It parses the APK via `aapt` to get the *real* internal version number, tags it, and uploads it to GitHub Releases.

### 3. The Generator (`mirror_generator.py`)
*   Runs after every release.
*   Scans your Releases page.
*   Updates `mirror.json` with direct download links so the Frontend doesn't hit GitHub API rate limits.
